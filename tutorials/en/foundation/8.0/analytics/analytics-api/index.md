## Configuring analytics on the client side
{: #configuring-analytics-on-the-client-side }

Before you can start collecting the predefined data that {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} provides, you must first import the corresponding libraries to initialize the analytics support.

### JavaScript (Cordova)
{: #javascript-cordova }

In Cordova applications, no setup is required and initialization is built-in.  

### JavaScript (Web)
{: #javascript-web }

In Web applications, the analytics JavaScript files must be referenced. Make sure you have first added the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Web SDK. For more information, see [Adding the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} SDK to Web applications](../../application-development/sdk/web) tutorial.  

Depending on how you've added the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Web SDK, proceed in either of the following ways:


Reference {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} in the `HEAD` element:

```html
<head>
    ...
    <script type="text/javascript" src="node_modules/ibm-mfp-web-sdk/lib/analytics/ibmmfpfanalytics.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="node_modules/ibm-mfp-web-sdk/ibmmfpf.js"></script>
</head>
```

Or, if using RequireJS, write:

```javascript
require.config({
	'paths': {
		'ibmmfpfanalytics': 'node_modules/ibm-mfp-web-sdk/lib/analytics/ibmmfpfanalytics',
		'mfp': 'node_modules/ibm-mfp-web-sdk/ibmmfpf'
	}
});

require(['ibmmfpfanalytics','mfp'], function(ibmmfpfanalytics, WL) {
    // application logic.
});
```

Note that you can select your own namespace to replace "ibmmfpfanalytics".


```javascript
ibmmfpfanalytics.logger.config({analyticsCapture: true});
```

 **Important**: Some JavaScript API differences exist between the Cordova and Web SDKs. Please refer to the [API Reference topic](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHS8R_8.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.apiref.doc/topics/r_apiref.html) in the user documentation.

### iOS
{: #ios }

#### Import the WLAnalytics library
{: #importing-the-wlanalytics-library }

**Objective-C**

```objc
import "WLAnalytics.h"
```

**Swift**

```Swift
import IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundation
```

#### Initialize Analytics
{: #initialize-analytics }

**Objective-C**  
No setup required. Pre-initialized by default.

**Swift**  
Before calling other methods of the **WLAnalytics** class, call `WLAnalytics.sharedInstance()`.

### Android
{: #android }

#### Import WLAnalytics
{: #import-wlanalytics }

```java
import com.worklight.common.WLAnalytics;
```

#### Initialize Analytics
{: #initialize-analytics }

Inside the `onCreate` method of your main activity include:

```java
WLAnalytics.init(this.getApplication());
```


## Enabling/disabling client event types
{: #enablingdisabling-client-event-types }

The Analytics API gives the developer the freedom to enable and disable collecting Analytics for the event they want to visualize on their {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_console }}.

The {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} API allows for the capturing of the following metrics.

* **Lifecycle events**: app usage rates, usage duration, app crash rates
* **Network usage**: breakdown of API call frequencies, network performance metrics
* **Users**: users of the app that are identified by a supplied user ID
* **Custom analytics**: custom key/value pairs that are defined by the app developer

The initialization of the analytics API must be written in native code, even in Cordova apps.

 * To capture app usage, you must register app lifecycle event listeners before the relevant event occurs and before sending the data to the server.
 * To use the file system or native language and device features, the API must be initialized. If the API is used in a way that requires native device features (like the file system), but was not initialized, the API call fails. This behavior is especially true on Android.

**Note**: To build Cordova applications, the JavaScript Analytics API does not have methods to enable or disable the collection of `LIFECYCLE` or `NETWORK` events. In other words, Cordova applications come with `LIFECYCLE` and `NETWORK` events pre-enabled by default. If you want to disable these events, see [Client Lifecycle Events](#client-lifecycle-events) and [Client Network Events](#client-lifecycle-events).

### Client lifecycle events
{: #client-lifecycle-events }

After the Analytics SDK is configured, app sessions start to be recorded on the user's device. A session in {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} is recorded when the app is moved from the foreground to the background, which creates a session on the {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_console_short }}.

As soon as the device is set up to record sessions and you send your data, you can see the {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_console_short }} populated with data, as shown below.

![sessions-chart](analytics-app-sessions.png)

Enable or disable the collecting of app sessions using the {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_short }} API.

#### JavaScript
{: #javascript }

**Web**  
To use client lifecycle events, initialize analytics:

```javascript
ibmmfpfanalytics.logger.config({analyticsCapture: true});
```

**Cordova**  
To enable the capture of the lifecycle events, it must be initialized in the native platform of the Cordova app.

* For the iOS platform:
	* Open the **[Cordova application root folder] → platforms → ios → Classes** folder and find the  **AppDelegate.m** (Objective-C) or **AppDelegate.swift** (Swift) file.
	* Follow the iOS guide below to enable or disable `LIFECYCLE` activities.
	* Build the Cordova project by running the command: `cordova build`.

* For the Android platform:
	* Open the  **[Cordova application root folder] → platforms → android → src → com → sample → [app-name] → MainActivity.java** file.
	* Look for the `onCreate` method and follow the Android guide below to enable or disable `LIFECYCLE` activities.
	* Build the Cordova project by running the command: `cordova build`.

#### Android
{: #android }

To enable client lifecycle event logging:

```java
WLAnalytics.addDeviceEventListener(DeviceEvent.LIFECYCLE);
```

To disable client lifecycle event logging:

```java
WLAnalytics.removeDeviceEventListener(DeviceEvent.LIFECYCLE);
```

#### iOS
{: #ios }

To enable client lifecycle event logging:

**Objective-C:**

```objc
[[WLAnalytics sharedInstance] addDeviceEventListener:LIFECYCLE];
```

**Swift:**

```swift
WLAnalytics.sharedInstance().addDeviceEventListener(LIFECYCLE);
```

To disable client lifecycle event logging:

**Objective-C:**

```objc
[[WLAnalytics sharedInstance] removeDeviceEventListener:LIFECYCLE];
```

**Swift:**

```swift
WLAnalytics.sharedInstance().removeDeviceEventListener(LIFECYCLE);
```

### Client Network Activities
{: #client-network-activities }

Collection on adapters and the network occur in two different locations: on the client and on the server:

* The client collects information such as roundtrip time and payload size when you start collecting on the `NETWORK` device event.

* The server collects back-end information such as server processing time, adapter usage, used procedures.

Because the client and the server each collect their own information, charts do not display data until the client is configured to do so. To configure your client, you need to start collecting for the `NETWORK` device event and send it to the server.

#### JavaScript
{: #javascript }

**Web**  
To use client network events, initialize analytics:

```javascript
ibmmfpfanalytics.logger.config({analyticsCapture: true});
```

**Cordova**  
To enable the capture of the network events, it must be initialized in the native platform of the Cordova app.

* For the iOS platform:
	* Open the **[Cordova application root folder] → platforms → ios → Classes** folder and find the **AppDelegate.m** (Objective-C) or **AppDelegate.swift** file.
	* Follow the iOS guide below to enable or disable `NETWORK` activities.
	* Build the Cordova project by running the command: `cordova build`.

* For the Android platform: navigate to the subactivity of the main activity to disable.
	* Open the  **[Cordova application root folder] → platforms → ios → src → com → sample → [app-name] → MainActivity.java** file.
	* Look for the `onCreate` method and follow the Android guide below to enable or disable `NETWORK` activities.
	* Build the Cordova project by running the command: `cordova build`.

#### iOS
{: #ios }

To enable client network-event logging:

**Objective-C:**

```objc
[[WLAnalytics sharedInstance] addDeviceEventListener:NETWORK];
```

**Swift:**

```swift
WLAnalytics.sharedInstance().addDeviceEventListener(NETWORK);
```

To disable client network-event logging:

**Objective-C:**

```objc
[[WLAnalytics sharedInstance] removeDeviceEventListener:NETWORK];
```

**Swift:**

```swift
WLAnalytics.sharedInstance().removeDeviceEventListener(NETWORK);
```

#### Android
{: #android }

To enable client network-event logging:

```java
WLAnalytics.addDeviceEventListener(DeviceEvent.NETWORK);
```

To disable client network-event logging:

```java
WLAnalytics.removeDeviceEventListener(DeviceEvent.NETWORK);
```

## Custom events
{: #custom-events }

Use the following API methods to create custom events.

#### JavaScript (Cordova)
{: #javascript-cordova }

```javascript
WL.Analytics.log({"key" : 'value'});
```

#### JavaScript (Web)
{: #javascript-web }

For the web API, custom data is sent with the `addEvent` method.

```javascript
ibmmfpfanalytics.addEvent({'Purchases':'radio'});
ibmmfpfanalytics.addEvent({'src':'App landing page','target':'About page'});
```

#### Android
{: #android }

After setting the first two configurations, you can start to log data as in this example:

```java
JSONObject json = new JSONObject();
try {
    json.put("key", "value");
} catch (JSONException e) {
    // TODO Auto-generated catch block
    e.printStackTrace();
}

WLAnalytics.log("Message", json);
```

#### iOS
{: #ios }

After importing WLAnalytics, you can now use the API to collect custom data, as follows:

**Objective-C:**

```objc
NSDictionary *inventory = @{
    @"property" : @"value",
};

[[WLAnalytics sharedInstance] log:@"Custom event" withMetadata:inventory];
[[WLAnalytics sharedInstance] send];
```

**Swift:**

```swift
let metadata: [NSObject: AnyObject] = ["foo": "bar"];  
WLAnalytics.sharedInstance().log("hello", withMetadata: metadata);
```

## Tracking users
{: #tracking-users }

To track individual users, use the `setUserContext` method:

#### Cordova
{: #cordova }

Not supported.

#### Web applications
{: #web-applications }

```javascript
ibmmfpfanalytics.setUserContext(user);
```

#### iOS
{: #ios }

**Objective-C**

```objc
[[WLAnalytics sharedInstance] setUserContext:@"John Doe"];
```

**Swift**

```swift
WLAnalytics.sharedInstance().setUserContext("John Doe")
```

#### Android
{: #android }

```java
WLAnalytics.setUserContext("John Doe");
```

To un-track individual users, use the `unsetUserContext` method:

#### Cordova
{: #cordova }

Not supported.

#### Web applications
{: #web-applications }

There is no `unsetUserContext` in the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Web SDK. The user session ends after 30 minutes of inactivity, unless another call is made to `ibmmfpfanalytics.setUserContext(user)`.

#### iOS
{: #ios }

**Objective-C**

```objc
[[WLAnalytics sharedInstance] unsetUserContext];
```

**Swift**

```swift
WLAnalytics.sharedInstance().unsetUserContext
```

#### Android
{: #android }

```java
WLAnalytics.unsetUserContext();
```

## Sending Analytics data
{: #sending-analytics-data }

Sending Analytics is a crucial step to see client-side analytics on the Analytics Server. When data for the configured event types is collected for Analytics, the analytics logs are stored in a log file on the client device. The data from the file is sent to the {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_server }} by using `send` method of the Analytics API.

Consider sending the captured logs periodically to the server. Sending data at regular intervals ensures that you will see up-to-date analytic data in the {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_console }}.

#### JavaScript (Cordova)
{: #javascript-cordova }

In a Cordova application, use the following JavaScript API method:

```javascript
WL.Analytics.send();
```

#### JavaScript (Web)
{: #javascript-web }

In a Web application, use the following JavaScript API method (depending on the namespace you've selected):

```javascript
ibmmfpfanalytics.send();
```

#### iOS
{: #ios }

**Objective-C**

```objc
[[WLAnalytics sharedInstance] send];
```

**Swift**

```swift
WLAnalytics.sharedInstance().send();
```

#### Android
{: #android }

In an Android application, use the following Java API method:

```java
WLAnalytics.send();
```
